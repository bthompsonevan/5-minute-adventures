            Stone ruins lay before you. The ruins seem to be a small village. Nature has
            taken the area back over which makes traveling difficult. You are only able to move north.

            You see an empty archway, to your west, that leads into what seems to be an old stone house or
            at least what is left of it. The path also continues North.

            When you enter the archway the room is framed as a rough ten foot square. Disturbed
            leaves and dirt in the corner catch your eye. Do you want to investigate?
        </textBox>
        <yes>While investigating the ground gives way and you fall into a hole never to be found again.</yes>
        <no>Head back east to the pathway.</no>

            On the pathway you hear a pair of people heading towards you. They did not notice you.
            Do you want to hide behind some rubble?
        </textBox>
        <yes>Phew!  They passed.  It looks like they were a military patrol. You can still head north.</yes>
        <no>Uh Oh!  You were spotted and taken into custody for trespassing.</no>
